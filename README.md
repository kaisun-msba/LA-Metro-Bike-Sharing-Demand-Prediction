# LA-Metro-Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction

This is the final group project of Time Series Analysis with R. 

Background: 

Metro Bike Share offers convenient round-the-clock access to a fleet of bicycles for short trips and to get to and from transit on your schedule. Metro Bike Share is an additional public transportation option for locals and visitors to get around Downtown LA, Central LA, Pasadena, North Hollywood and the Westside. 

Tasks:  

Predict hourly bike sharing demand in each of the following regions individually:Downtown LA, Central LA, North Hollywood and the Westside and jointly:
●	Explore the data and present insights you gained from exploratory analysis
●	Perform model selection model based on several scenarios
●	Predict hourly Bike Sharing Demand for next quarter (2021 Q4)                                       
●	Each team will present (7-10 min) their work in class

Data: 

https://bikeshare.metro.net/about/data/ (must be imported from the website into R directly)

I analyzed joined data and incorporated weather data from National Center for Environmental Information (NOAA): https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/ 

My portion of the R script and the final deck can be found in this repo.
